When you are asked to plan, produce a unique PLAN-{descriptive-slug}.md file in `plans` folder. Make sure you include the design decisions, sections and use `[ ]` in front of the TODO items.

Always run `make dev`, `make test` after you've made changes. 
When you try to fix `make dev` issues, DO NOT attempt to modify the `pyproject.toml` file. Fix the issues in your code instead.
